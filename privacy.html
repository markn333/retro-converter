    <p>Images you select for conversion are processed locally on your device. They are never uploaded to any server or shared with any third party.</p>

    <h2>Photos Library Access</h2>
    <p>The App may request access to your photo library solely to allow you to select images for conversion and to save converted images. This access is used only when you explicitly initiate these actions.</p>
